Write a class that spits out random matrix

mat A = new matrix(m,n)			//gives random matrix

Write functionality in class matrix which accepts user-defined matrix
What form is the matrix stored in? How would PSI4 or TiledArray give you the matrix?
Constructor overloading.

Print funtionality in class matrix

Transpose matrix in class matrix

Matrix Computations will be another class
Has funtionality for dense matrix multiplication
sparse mm
error : matrix dim dont match

This class should take inputs matrix object_A and matrix object_B
